\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Git}
Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It enables teams to collaborate efficiently, maintain a detailed history of changes, and manage multiple versions of a project simultaneously. Git is widely used in software development, research, and documentation projects.
\subsection{LaTex}
LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly used for creating structured and professional documents. It excels at producing high-quality outputs for academic papers, reports, and books. The combination of Git and LaTeX is particularly powerful for researchers and developers as it provides a robust framework for collaboration and version control while maintaining document integrity.
